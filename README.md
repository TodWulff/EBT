EBT - Extended Basic Tools  (screen shot: https://i.imgur.com/dUVv7lu.png)

Extended Basic Tools (EBT) is a set of extensions for the Coridium BASICtools IDE which Coridium Corporation provides for
free when used with any of the Coridium SBC Boards.  EBT is provided for free and relies on the existence of BASICtools.
Without BASICtools, EBT is, by design, materially non-functional.  The scope of this document is related to EBT and it is
not intended to be a User Manual for Coridiumâ€™s BASICtools IDE (BT).  This work assumes that one has a basic to good
understanding of BT, ARMbasic, and how to use each on SBCs that have ARMbasic Firmware thereon.
